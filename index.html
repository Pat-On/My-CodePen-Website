    <h1>MSI GE75 Raider</h1>
    <p>MSI's GE75 Raider (starts at $1,749; $2,999 as tested) is a high-end 17.3-inch gaming laptop. This model raises the bar over the outgoing GE73 Raider, integrating much-improved gaming performance into a sleeker design. A six-core processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card in our topped-out tester have no trouble pushing triple-digit frames-per-second (fps) in today's AAA titles. Paired with a 1080p/144Hz display, this MSI makes an ideal platform for esports titles and other fast-action games. <br>The performance leaves little room for complaint, but intrusive fan noise, a lack of Nvidia G-Sync support, and extremely brief battery life tarnish its appeal. Indeed, MSI's own GS75 Stealth ( at Amazon) , with a thinner and lighter design, way better battery, and near-identical gaming performance remains our top pick for a premium 17.3-inch gamer.</p>

    <h1>Time for a Makeover</h1>
    <p>The GE75 Raider is second to MSI's flagship GT75 Titan ($2,774.00 at Newegg) in performance (and price); the GT75 packs a more powerful Intel Core i9-8950HK processor versus this tester's Intel Core i7-8750H. For a more portable option, the GS75 Stealth is just 0.75 inch thick and under five pounds, with less storage expansion the key trade-off. Meanwhile, the GL73 is the budget choice, offering up to GeForce RTX 2060 GPUs. <br>
      Much of the size and weight reduction is related to the thin-bezel display on the GE75 Raider, effectively making it not much larger than a 15.6-inch notebook with a thicker bezel. I'm all for this trend in notebook design, as it results in a cleaner look and improved portability. MSI was still able to fit the webcam on top of the display in its rightful place, which isn't a guarantee with notebooks that shrink the bezels. Alas, the camera's tiny sensor and low 720p resolution (I'd really like to see 1080p in the year 2019, please and thanks) make for muddy selfies, even in the best of lighting.</p>

  <section id="third">
    <h1>144Hz Is Refreshing... But Where's G-Sync?</h1>
    <p>SAll GE75 Raider configurations include the same 17.3-inch display. Its combination of a 144Hz refresh rate and a 1080p (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) resolution is ideal for fast-paced esports titles.
      It's most unfortunate, then, that the display lacks support for Nvidia G-Sync technology, especially at the price range of our maxed-out test unit. (See our Best Graphics Cards for Apex Legends feature for the run-down on why monitors matter for esports.)

      Just about every other aspect of the display on the GE75 Raider earns a thumbs-up. The panel's in-plane switching (IPS) technology provides wide viewing angles, while the anti-glare surface nullifies reflections. The brightness and color are very good; MSI claims the panel covers 72 percent of the NTSC color gamut, which is well above the norm for a notebook display.</p>
